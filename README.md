## What is this?

## Install
PS: this assumes you have linux :)

to install, you can either download the binary from the releases, or you can clone the repository, and ( after you install go), you can run `go install` in the cloned folder, then add the go/ folder in your home directory to the path. 

## How Do I use It?

if you run it with no arguments, it won't do anything. (we know, that will be fixed!) the arguments you can choose are: 
* `create [no arguments]` which creates a new blank `.plan.txt` file in your home directory, 
* `add [item, multiple words are in quotes]` which adds a new item to your todo list, and 
* `check-off [number of the item]` which checks an item off.
