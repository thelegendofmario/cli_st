## What is this?

## Install
PS: this assumes you have linux :)

to install, you can either download the binary from the releases, or you can clone the repository, and ( after you install go), you can run `go install` in the cloned folder, then add the go/ folder in your home directory to the path. 

## How Do I use It?
